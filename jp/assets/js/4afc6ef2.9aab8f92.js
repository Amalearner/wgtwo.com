Those with a subscription from a Working Group Two powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription by enabling products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>We are creating a product ecosystem, which is a multi-sided marketplace platform. Our solution consists of three main components:<br><br><ul><li>Developer Portal: Enabling developers to use APIs and media streams for Messaging, Data, and Voice, and to submit their product to our marketplace.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner Console: Allowing mobile operators to buy, manage, and distribute products to their subscribers.</li><li>Storefront: Letting mobile subscribers find, activate and launch the products they want to add to their subscription.</li></ul><br>THE POSITION<br>You\u2019re not afraid to get your hands dirty! You will be making both public and internal APIs, backend services, as well as architectural decisions. You will also help set up and maintain the required infrastructure for our projects. You won\u2019t be alone though, we already have a team member who is responsible for these exact things, so you will get a lot of help easing into the role.<br><br>At Working Group Two we don\u2019t have a dedicated operations team, so parts of what you will be doing may be described as a devops job. All our services run in Kubernetes hosted at AWS, so you won\u2019t need to touch actual hardware.
