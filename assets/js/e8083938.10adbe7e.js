For me it has been valuable to have so many colleagues to look up to and learn from as that has given me what I believe to be the best conditions for rapid growth. The key is to have a curious and open-to-learn mindset - if you do you will have no problem growing here. The role you take in this company is often shaped according to your interests and skills. In my case, I wanted to be more involved with the customers and follow their journey onto our platform, as well as making sure they are satisfied once migration is done. That led me to this team. Coordinating and collaborating with the development teams on behalf of our customers is one of the main responsibilities of our team as we want to deliver the best experience of our platform. That\'s where you\'ll play a key role!<br><br>Though playing such an important role may seem daunting, you will have the whole team around to support you and help you learn about our system while solving issues. In our team we want everyone to feel productive, meaning we want everyone to learn and share knowledge. We also continuously evaluate our processes to cut parts where we don\'t see any value so we can focus on our core activities. Besides that, we are very keen on meeting up on any location of our team members to get to work together and have fun (post-covid of course). During covid, we have focused on having weekly tech-talks where we discuss and share knowledge on the projects we work on and also other more purely social initiatives online where we can chat about anything, which has proven to be even more valuable than we expected. Our team has many exciting opportunities and projects coming up, so if you are looking to join the fun with us - apply!<br><br>If you would like to read more about how we do things you are welcome to take a look at some of our blog posts:<br><a href=\\"https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/manual-on-me-matt-long/\\">https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/manual-on-me-matt-long/</a><br><a href=\\"https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/were-all-grownups-here/\\">https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/were-all-grownups-here/</a>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}')}}]);
