Lawyers, real estate agents, plumbers - they might get dozens of calls every day. So where others turn off voicemail, these people might want to get their voicemails forwarded to their emails, be able to share their inbox with a colleague or assistant, have voicemails automatically translated to text and integrate their messages with productivity tools like Asana or an ERP system. Some need to have their messages stored for regulatory or security purposes. A real estate agent with (say) 10 000 contacts may want to customize the greetings so that every time one of the 200 Johns or Jessicas call, they get a personal message stating their name. To some, that might be a differentiator, to others a nuisance.

"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"That\u2019s essentially what Working Group Two and the Swedish mobile operator challenger Vimla did. In response to a regulatory challenge by the Swedish Post & Telecom Authority (PTS), Vimla recently launched a voicemail service where messages get delivered to a user\u2019s phone as an audio file (via MMS). The customer can listen to it whenever he/she wants without needing to dial into the messaging system. As a result, hackers can no longer get access to other people\u2019s voicemails (which PTS had set out to stop) and customers get a better messaging experience. "),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"This simple, yet elegant solution serves as a powerful example of another and more fundamental development in the telecom industry. For a few years, Working Group Two has developed and managed the mobile core network of Vimla as-a-service in the cloud, enabling Vimla to operate its network both more efficiently and taking advantage of micro innovation at scale. When this challenge came around from PTS it took Vimla only a few months to respond with this lightweight and efficient solution. Working Group Two\u2019s developers used existing APIs to connect two otherwise separate systems (voicemail and MMS). The API-based bridge between them allowed voicemails to be sent as MMS. Today, tens of thousands messages are sent every day in the Vimla network.
